 ======== ***Problem Statement:*** =========== <br/>
Artificial intelligence (AI) research in healthcare is accelerating rapidly, with potential applications being demonstrated across various domains of medicine. However, there are currently limited examples of such techniques being successfully deployed into clinical practice.
The goal of this project is to implement Deep learning in medical science.
This project is all about a Machine Learning based Medical Test web app which makes predictions about various diseases using AI.
We will be covering many different Diseases and ML/Deep Learning Models some of which include:-
Heart Disease Detection - Using Logistic Regression
Liver Disease - Using K-Means
Breast Cancer Prediction - Using Convolution Neural Network
Malaria detection â€“ Using convolutional Neural network
Pneumonia classification - Using KNN and SVM.


 ======== ***Languages Used:*** =========== <br/>
 HTML-5<br/>
CSS-3<br/>
Bootstrap-4<br/>
JavaScript<br/>
Jquery<br/>
Flask<br/>
